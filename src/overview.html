	<p>A good starting point is the image package, since it contains
		the relevant information about image representation in the system
		where the rest of the program is based on. The packages <i>cbir.image</i>,
		<i>cbir.retriever</i>, <i>cbir.metric</i> provide the core functionality of a cbir
		system.</p>
	<p>The package <i>cbir.reader</i> is needed to feed previously generated
		image descriptors to our system. This is mandatory because the current
		system does not provide any feature extration functionality.</p>
	<p>The packages <i>ind.kdtree</i> and <i>rf.*</i> are extensions that should
		improve the performance and the precision of the system. Due to the
		fact that our kd-tree implementation does not improve the performance
		you might want to change the index structure.</p>
	<p>Informations about the usage of our system can be found in the
		<i>README</i> file and the <i>example.pdf</i>.</p>
